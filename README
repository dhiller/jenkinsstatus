Aim
---

Create a visually appealing status monitor for a jenkins server using Java that can be started via JNLP


Sketch
------

 - Displays all jobs of a jenkins server, each one in a new line
 - Each line consists of
   - three leds (green, yellow, red), of which 
     - only one is switched on according to the jenkins status
     - if a job is running the led that has been on last is blinking
   - a label with the job name (linked to the job webpage)
   - a button to expand the panel for job details
     - Test delta ((number of tests of current build) - ((number of tests of last build))
     - Success rate (100% green, < 100% red)
     - Health reports
     - (later) Maven submodules?
